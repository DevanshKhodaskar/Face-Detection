# Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

## Overview
This script detects faces and eyes in a video using OpenCV's Haar cascades and highlights them with rectangles.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
```

## How to Run
1. Update the `video_path` in the script to your video file path.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```
3. Press `x` to exit the video window.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic example of using OpenCV for face and eye detection. Experiment with different videos and tweak the detection parameters for improved results.
